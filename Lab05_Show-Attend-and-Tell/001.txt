ok, let get started.
As you know, Artificial Intelligent has become very popular in recent years.
In this presentation, I want to tell you about how computers view images and
show you the machanism of computer vision.

One of the primary goals of computer vision is to automatically generate 
captions of an image, since this is a task very close to the heart of 
scene understanding.

To achieve this goal, the caption generating model must not only be able to 
detect which objects are in an image, but be capable of expressing their
relationships in a natural language.

For this reason, caption generating model has long been viewed as a difficult
problem.

The main idea I want to show you is :
under the architecture called Deep Neural Network, computers could build its
own attentions and produce captions after giving many examples.

The example are several thousands of images and each image have 5 or more 
corresponding captions.

The Deep Neural Network architecture has about thousands of parameters need
to be determined. Examples are used to let the model find proper parameters.

All images and word will be expressed as numerical numbers in the model so that 
the model could generate the caption of highest probability and
adjust parameters if the generated caption is what we didn't expect. 

In fact, each attention of an image in the model generate a word and a 
caption is generated after viewing a number of attentions.

The tatol training time would take about 3 days with the add of graphic card acceleration.

At the end, we can see where computers focus on when they are generating captions and 
viewing an image. This may help human to detect or recognize some object 
without being there themself, and bring many conveninces to our lives.
 
Thank you very much.
